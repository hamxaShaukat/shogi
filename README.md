# shogi
Implemented a console version of Shogi (Japanese Chess) in C++. The project includes mouse-based piece move, legal movement, undo/redo, highlighting moves, save/load functionality, and detection of check, checkmate, and stalemate. I designed and coded the complete logic, board representation by 2D arrays, and interaction through console utilities.
